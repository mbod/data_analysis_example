## My example data analysis site

This is an example of using a github repo for organization and data analysis and also for publishing analysis on a webpage.


### Load the data

```{r load_data}

df <- read.csv('data/apprate_language_in_complete_liwc_classified_descriptives_032417.csv')
```

### Investigate the data

Use `dplyr` functions to select and summarise features.


* LWIC social language scores

```{r analysis}
select(df, social)[1:100,]
```
